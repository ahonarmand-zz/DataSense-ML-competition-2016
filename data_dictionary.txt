           Description: Refers to the census metropolitan area (CMA) or
           census agglomeration (CA) where current residence is located
           (2006). Please note that contrary to the variables CMA1 and
           CMA5, the variable CMA does not distinguish between the
           non-CMA/CA areas of the territories and those in the rest of the
           country. Users interested in making this distinction for
           comparability purposes may use the variable province of
           residence (PR).

           (other than foreign residents) who occupy the same dwelling and
           do not have a usual place of residence elsewhere in Canada. It

           absent on Census Day (e.g., temporary residents elsewhere) are
           considered as part of their usual household. For census
           purposes, every person is a member of one and only one
           household. Unless otherwise specified, all data in household
           reports are for private households only. Private household
           refers to a person or a group of persons (other than foreign
           residents) who occupy a private dwelling and do not have a usual
           place of residence elsewhere in Canada. Other Households Refers

      pkidhh             Presence of children in Census family households

           Description: Refers to the presence of children in census
           families in private households. Children refer to blood, step-

           status) who are living in the same dwelling as their parent(s),
           as well as grandchildren in households where there are no
           parents present. Sons and daughters who are living with their
           spouse or common-law partner, or with one or more of their own
           children, are not considered to be members of the census family
           of their parent(s), even if they are living in the same
           dwelling. In addition, the sons or daughters who do not live in
           the same dwelling as their parent(s) are not considered members
           of the census family of their parent(s). When sons or daughters
           study or have a summer job elsewhere but return to live with
           their parent(s) during the year, these sons and daughters are
           considered members of the census family of their parent(s).

      prihm              Primary household maintainer indicator

           Description: The first person in the household identified as
           being the household maintainer. This variable identifies the
           first household maintainer entered in Question H1. Due to
           changes in questionnaire design and data capture, the method of
           identifying the primary household maintainer in 2006, 2001 and
           1996 differs slightly from that of 1991. These changes may
           affect households where two or more persons contribute towards
           shelter expenses. As a result, the characteristics of the
           primary household maintainer in 2006, 2001 and 1996 may not be
           strictly comparable to those released in the 1991 Census. In the
           1981 and 1986 censuses, only one person could be counted as
           being the household maintainer. Comparisons with the 2006, 2001,
           1996 and 1991 censuses can be carried out using the Primary
           household maintainer variable.

      ageimm             Age at immigration

           Description: Refers to the age at which the respondent first
           obtained landed immigrant status. A landed immigrant is a person
           who has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by
           immigration authorities. Age at immigration is calculated using
           the year of immigration, the year of birth, and an estimated
           month of immigration. Respondents who answered 'Yes' to the
           landed immigrant status question (Question 11) were asked to
           answer the year of immigration question (Question 12) by
           reporting the year in which they first obtained landed immigrant
           status. People who answered 'No' to Question 11 will not have
           gone through the immigration process and, thus, do not have a
           year of immigration or an age at immigration. These people are
           Canadian citizens by birth or non-permanent residents (people
           from another country who have a study or work permit, or who
           were refugee claimants at the time of the census, and family
           members living here with them). Age at immigration data are
           available since the 1981 Census. Censuses taken earlier than in
           1981 had only periods of immigration, i.e., ranges of years,
           which made it impossible to calculate the age at immigration.

      citizen            Citizenship

           Description: Refers to the legal citizenship status of the
           respondent. Persons who are citizens of more than one country
           were instructed to provide the name of the other country(ies).
           Canadian citizens were asked to distinguish between Canadian
           citizenship by birth and Canadian citizenship by naturalization.
           Persons who were born outside Canada and who are Canadian
           citizens by birth were requested to report 'Canada, by birth'.
           In 2006, as in 1996 and 2001, a space was provided for a
           write-in response, as well as for the mark-in responses of
           'Canada, by birth' and 'Canada, by naturalization'. Respondents
           could write in a country of citizenship other than Canada.
           Multiple responses to the citizenship question were also
           accepted. In the 1971 Census, respondents were asked to indicate
           specific countries of citizenship. In 1981, 1986 and 1991, the
           format of the question was changed. For those censuses,
           citizenship information for specific countries is available, but
           only for respondents who indicated the same country for their
           citizenship and their place of birth. Data for the 2006 Census,
           as in 1996 and 2001, will not be published for all countries of
           citizenship and dual citizenship. Unpublished data relating to
           persons who indicated dual citizenship are available upon
           special request, subject to restrictions imposed to ensure

      citoth             Citizenship other than Canadian

           Description: The census citizenship question refers not only to
           Canadian citizenship status but also to citizenships of
           countries other than Canada. In the 1991 citizenship question,
           two answer circles were provided for respondents to indicate if
           they were citizens of their country of birth and/or citizens of
           another country. In 1996, 2001 and 2006, these two answer
           circles were removed, and respondents were to write in the
           name(s) of the country(ies), other than Canada, where they held
           citizenship. This new variable refers to citizenship(s) other
           than Canadian held by respondents, regardless of their Canadian
           citizenship status. For respondents who reported a single
           citizenship other than Canadian, countries of citizenship are
           shown separately, subject to confidentiality constraints.
           Responses of individuals who indicated multiple citizenships
           other than Canadian (e.g., France and Spain) are aggregated
           under the 'Multiple citizenships other than Canadian' code.

           2001 or 2006 censuses. VISMINH differs from the non-historical
           version of the variable (VISMIN) in that it includes a combined
           stub for 'Arab/West Asian', rather than separate stubs for these
           groups. Before 1996, visible minority data were derived using
           Place of Birth, Ethnic Origin, Mother Tongue and, when
           available, Religion. Since 1996, a direct question has been
           asked. Precaution should therefore be taken when comparing data
           before 1996 with data from 1996 onwards as the collection tool
           for visible minority data has changed.

      aboid              Aboriginal identity

           Description: Refers to those persons who reported identifying
           with at least one Aboriginal group, that is, North American
           Indian, MÃ©tis or Inuit, and/or those who reported being a Treaty
           Indian or a Registered Indian, as defined by the Indian Act of
           Canada, and/or those who reported they were members of an Indian
           band or First Nation. In 1991 and previous censuses, the
           Aboriginal population was defined using the ethnic origin
           question (ancestry). The 1996 Census included a question on the
           individual's perception of his/her Aboriginal identity. The
           question used in the 2006 and 2001 censuses is the same as the
           one used in 1996. Caution should be exercised in analyzing
           trends for Aboriginal peoples based on previous census data.
           Over time, patterns in Aboriginal self-identification have
           changed. In recent years, a growing number of people who had not
           previously identified with an Aboriginal group are now doing so.
           Changes in Aboriginal participation in the Census over time also
           result in comparability issues. There are different ways to
           define the Aboriginal population in Canada. The 2006 Census also
           provides information on persons who reported at least one
           Aboriginal ancestry in the ethnic origin question. Depending on
           the application, data on either identity or ethnic
           origin/ancestry may be appropriate for defining the Aboriginal
           population. Users should be aware that the counts for North
           American Indian single response are more affected than most by
           the incomplete enumeration of certain Indian reserves and Indian
           settlements. The extent of the impact will depend on the
           geographic area under study. In 2006, a total of 22 Indian
           reserves and Indian settlements were incompletely enumerated by
           the census. The populations of these 22 communities are not
           included in the census counts.

      bfnmemb            Band or First Nation membership

           Description: Refers to those persons who reported being a member
           of an Indian band or a First Nation of Canada. In 1991, band
           membership was a subcomponent of Question 16 on Registered
           Indians. In the first part of this question, respondents were
           asked about registration status, while the second part of the
           question dealt with band membership. In 1996, one direct
           question was developed to collect data on band/First Nation
           membership. Many Indian bands have elected to call themselves a
           First Nation and have changed their band name to reflect this.
           Also, with the 1985 amendment to theof Canada (Bill C-31), many
           Indian bands exercised the right to establish their own
           membership code, whereby it was not always necessary for a band
           member to be a Registered Indian according to the. The 2006
           Census used the same question as in 1996 and 2001

           VALUE  LABEL

      regind             Registered or Treaty Indian

           Description: Refers to those persons who reported they were
           registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are
           persons who are registered under the Indian Act and can prove
           descent from a band that signed a treaty. Although there was a
           question in the 1991 Census on registration status, the layout
           of the 1996 question was somewhat different. In 1991, Question
           16 on Registered Indians had two components. In the first part
           of the question, respondents were asked about their registration
           status, while the second part of the question dealt with band
           membership. The question used in 1996 asked only for
           registration or treaty status, while band membership was dealt
           with in a separate question. The wording of the question,
           starting in 1996, differs slightly from the one in previous
           censuses. Prior to 1996, the term 'treaty' was not included in
           the question. It was added in 1996 at the request of individuals
           from the Western provinces, where the term is more widely used.
           The 2006 Census question is the same as the one used in 1996 and
           2001. The Registered Indian counts in this data file may differ
           from the administrative counts maintained by the Department of
           Indian Affairs and Northern Development, with the most important
           causes of these differences being the incompletely enumerated
           Indian reserves and Indian settlements as well as methodological
           and conceptual differences between the two sources.

      ethder             Derived single and selected multiple ethnic origins

           Description: This variable provides a distribution of the total
           population by single responses and selected multiple responses
           to the ethnic origin question (Question 17). Due to the
           increasingly high proportion of respondents who report multiple
           origins in the census, it is recommended that this variable be
           used for only very specific purposes. The abbreviation 'n.i.e.'
           means 'not included elsewhere.' The abbreviation 'n.o.s.' means
           'not otherwise specified.' For additional information on issues
           related to the collection and dissemination of ethnic origin
           data, and on the comparability of ethnic origin data over time,

           Description: This variable represents one of three possible
           answers provided by a respondent. Refers to the language used on
           a regular basis at work by the individual at the time of the
           census. If more than one language was used, the language used
           most often by the individual was to be reported. When comparing
           the census results to those of the 2001 Census, it appears that
           there is some overestimation of persons reporting Dakota/Sioux
           (Siouan languages) in British Columbia and, as a result, also at
           the Canada level. Although it affects a relatively small
           population, it is best to apply caution when analysing the
           census data for Dakota/Sioux (Siouan languages) in these
           geographies.

      nol                Single and multiple responses to the non-official language question

           Description: This is the same question as in 1991, 1996, and
           2001. The non-official language data are based on the
           respondent's assessment of his or her ability to speak
           non-official languages. There are two spaces for reporting
           non-official languages in 2006; there were three spaces in 2001.
           In 2006, the following instructions were provided to respondents
           in the 2006 Census Guide: Report only those languages in which
           the person can carry on a conversation of some length on various
           topics. For a child who has not yet learned to speak: Report a
           language other than English or French that the child is learning
           to speak at home. On the French version of all census forms, for
           all questions in the language module where there is a choice of
           response available, the order in which the choices appear was
           modified since 1996 in order to give precedence to the category
           'French.' The questions on knowledge of official languages and
           non-official languages also reflect this change in the actual
           wording of the questions. This question was asked for the first
           time in the 1991 Census. Appendix H provides a list of the
           non-official languages released in 2006, 2001, and 1996.

      attsch             Attendance at school

           Description: Refers to attendance during the nine -month period
           between September 2005 and May 16, 2006. An individual's
           attendance could be either full time or part time (day or
           evening), even if the individual dropped out after registration.
           Attendance was counted only for courses which could be used as
           credits towards a certificate, diploma or degree from a
           recognized educational institution (elementary or secondary
           school, the in-class portion of registered apprenticeship
           programs, trade schools, colleges, CEGEPs and universities).
           Recognized education institutions also included seminaries,
           schools of nursing, private business schools, private or public
           trade schools, institutes of technology, vocational schools, or
           schools for people who are deaf or blind. Attendance at school
           was not counted for training received from an employer unless it
           could be used as credit towards a certificate, diploma or degree
           from a recognized educational institution. Counts for those aged
           15 to 19 attending school in the 2001 Census were lower than
           expected and not replicated in other sources. In 2006, changes
           to the questionnaire brought results for those aged 15 to 19
           back in to line with censuses prior to 2001. While the results
           for those aged 20 to 44 are comparable over time, the 2006
           Census overestimated school attendance for the population aged
           45 years or over. As a result, it is recommended that the data
           on school attendance be used with caution and it is not
           recommended to compare data for the ages 45 and over from 2006
           with previous censuses. For more information, please see the
           Education Reference Guide, 2006 Census.

      cip                Major field of study (based on the CIP Canada 2000)

           Description: Refers to the predominant discipline or area of
           learning or training of a person's highest postsecondary
           certificate, diploma or degree. The Classification of
           Instructional Programs (CIP Canada 2000) major field of study
           classification structure consists of 13 major categories or
           primary groupings, 12 of which are used for the census (the
           category which includes courses in personal development is not
           used). The 12 primary groupings are: education; visual and
           performing arts, and communications technologies; humanities;
           social and behavioural sciences and law; business, management
           and public administration; physical and life sciences and
           technologies; mathematics, computer and information sciences;

           natural resources and conservation; health, parks, recreation
           and fitness; personal, protective and transportation services;
           other. The major field of study data in the 2006 Census were
           also recoded using the MFS classification that was used prior to
           the 2006 Census. Future censuses will present information coded
           to the CIP classification system only. For historical analysis,

      hdgree             Highest certificate, diploma or degree

           Description: Information indicating the person's most advanced
           certificate, diploma or degree. This is a derived variable
           obtained from the educational qualifications questions, which
           asked for all certificates, diplomas and degrees to be reported.
           There is an implied hierarchy in this variable (secondary school
           graduation, registered apprenticeship and trades, college,
           university) which is loosely tied to the 'in-class' duration of
           the various types of education. However, at the detailed level a
           registered apprenticeship graduate may not have completed a
           secondary school certificate or diploma, nor does an individual
           with a masterâ€™s degree necessarily have a certificate or diploma
           above the bachelorâ€™s degree level. Therefore, although the
           sequence is more or less hierarchical, it is a general rather
           than an absolute gradient measure of academic achievement. The
           questions on completed credentials changed significantly in 2006
           compared to previous censuses (for a complete discussion of the
           changes, see the Education Reference Guide, Census 2006).
           Specifically, the 2006 Census included a unique question for
           each level of educational attainment, rather than including all
           levels as part of a single list (as was done in censuses prior
           to 2006). While most of the individual levels of educational
           attainment are found to be comparable historically, some changes
           observed over time are the result of changes to the
           questionnaire. Users should be aware that underreporting of high
           school completions contributed to elevated results for the less
           than high school category in censuses prior to 2006, as well as
           impacting the data for high school graduation. A change was made
           in the 2006 Census questionnaire to specifically include
           certification by a type of educational institution found only in
           Quebec, the 'centres de formation professionelle,' and this has
           influenced the data on trade certifications in Quebec. Users of
           the 'University certificate or diploma below the bachelor level'
           category should know that an unexpected increase in this
           category was noted compared to the 2001 Census. It is
           recommended that users not compare this category in 2006 with
           previous censuses. The college category and university
           categories at the bachelor's level and above are comparable over
           time. For more information, please see the Education Reference
           Guide, 2006 Census.

           Description: Refers to the predominant discipline or area of
           learning or training of a person's highest postsecondary degree,
           certificate or diploma. The historical Major Field of Study
           (MFS) classification structure consists of 11 broad or major
           categories: educational, recreational and counselling services;
           fine and applied arts; humanities and related fields; social
           sciences and related fields ; commerce, management and business
           administration; agricultural, biological, nutritional and food

           technologies and trades; health professions and related
           technologies; mathematics, computers and physical sciences; and
           no specialization. This structure is, in turn, subdivided into
           110 'minor' classification categories and 449 'unit' groups.
           Note that for the 2006 PUMF, the last major category, â€˜No
           specialization,â€™ was merged with â€˜Humanities and related fieldsâ€™
           due to its negligible size relative to the other MFS categories.

      ssgrad             High school graduation certificate or equivalent

           Description: Refers to the possession of a secondary (high)
           school graduation certificate or its equivalent, regardless of
           whether other educational qualifications are held or not. This
           variable separates the population into those persons with and
           those without a high school graduation certificate or its
           equivalent. It also provides information on any additional
           education that may have been completed by these two populations.
           The education questions in the census underwent significant
           changes in 2006 and, as a result, not all variables are
           historically comparable. For the first time, the 2006 Census
           included an explicit question asking Canadians to report whether
           they had completed high school, with a separate category for
           completion of high school equivalencies. This change was made to
           address suspected underreporting of high school completions. In
           previous censuses, all levels of education were included in a
           single list, with many respondents reporting only their highest
           credential rather than all credentials earned. In addition to
           the changes to the questionnaire, the secondary (high) school
           graduation variable was derived differently in 2006 than in 2001
           with a focus on completed credentials. As a result of these
           changes, only the following categories in the 'high school
           certificate or equivalent' variable may be considered for
           comparison to previous censuses: 'No high school certificate or
           equivalent without further schooling' and 'With high school
           certificate or equivalent with a university degree' -- from
           bachelor's degree to earned doctorate degree. For more
           information, please see the Education Reference Guide, 2006

           are produced according to the 2002 NAICS. The NAICS provides
           enhanced industry comparability among the three North American
           Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trading partners (Canada, United
           States and Mexico). This classification consists of a systematic
           and comprehensive arrangement of industries structured into 20
           sectors, 103 subsectors and 328 industry groups. The criteria
           used to create these categories are similar to input structures,
           labour skills or production processes used by the establishment.

      tenur              Tenure

           Description: Refers to whether some member of the household owns
           or rents the dwelling, or whether the dwelling is band housing
           (on an Indian reserve or settlement). A dwelling is classified
           as 'owned' even if it is not fully paid for, such as one which
           has a mortgage or some other claim on it. The dwelling may be
           situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium
           (whether registered or unregistered). A dwelling is classified
           as 'rented' even if it is provided without cash rent or at a
           reduced rent, or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative. For
           census purposes, in a cooperative, all members jointly own the
           cooperative and occupy their dwelling units under a lease
           agreement. For historical and statutory reasons, shelter
           occupancy on reserves does not lend itself to the usual
           classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore, a
           special category 'band housing' has been created for 1991 census
           products. Band housing also appears in the 1996 and 2001 Census
           products.
